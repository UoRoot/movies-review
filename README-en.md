# MoviesReview

Welcome to MoviesReview, my first project as I embarked on my React journey! This app allows users to browse and review movies, showcasing my initial steps into the world of modern web development.

## Getting Started

To run either of these 2 versions of the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Diplock25/movies-review.git
cd movies-review/[...version]
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The api_key used in version 1.0.0 of this project does not work, I recommend you to create an account at [TMBD API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)

## About the Project

MoviesReview was built using React and Vite, providing a fast development experience and optimized build process. As my first React project, it represents the beginning of my journey in mastering this powerful library.

## Features

- Browse a selection of movies
- Search and filter movies
- View movie details

## Why two versions?

As I was just starting out and due to personal circumstances, I had to complete the project without fully leveraging all of React's powerful features. As a result, the app's performance may not be as optimal as it could be.

I've since revisited this concept with more experience under my belt. You can check out the maintained and optimized version of this project here: [MoviesReview 2.0](https://github.com/Diplock25/movies-review/2.0.0)

Thank you for checking out my first React project!
